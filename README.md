# ClickN Challenge

ClickN Challenge for matching algorithm

## Challenge Description

We have a json file that contain products from different sources
The items have the same field structure as follows:

```
{
    "_id", // id for the item: type ObjectId
    "store", // contains store name: type string
    "category", // contains category of said item : type string
    "brand", // contains item brand: type string
    "name", // contains product name: type string
    "description", // contains description of the product: type string
    "image", // contains a link to the image of the product: type string
    "measurement", // contains the measurement of the product: type string
    "price", // contains the price of the product: type double
}
```

We want a function that would take the id of a product and return a list of the other items in the json file that describe the same product

```
find_item_list(string item_id):
return(list)
```
